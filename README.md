# Project-Distance-between-cities
  In this project user can input destination point and origin point(Autocomplete the places name), 
  then the user will get how many times needs to reach the destination point and how many distance 
  user will cover which will show in the map alongside a div. In this project, I use bootstrap, 
  javascript(Especially works on google maps & google API), Ajax, and PHP.
